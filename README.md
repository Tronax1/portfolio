# Portfolio

## This is my online portfolio 

**My work includes**

* Aldebaran: A Discord music bot application
* Scientific calculator: Calculator made in Visual Studio with forms
* Tic-Tac-Toe: A player vs player tic-tac-toe game
* Knight's move game: A player vs AI game

##Approach
To have a solid web application, I used the React library for the front-end
and Express for back-end. The back-end will handle all the form processing such as the
"Contact me" form, and the pdf of my resume.

##What did I learn
I learned how to apply all my knowledge of CSS, HTML and Javascript along with React to create
my own personal responsive website. I also learned how to implement and connect a back-end to the front-end
using Express.
